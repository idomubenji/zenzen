      "content": "You're absolutely right! These stores are fascinating examples of Japanese retail culture. Daiso revolutionized the 100-yen shop concept with high-quality items, while Don Quijote (or 'Donki') became famous for its maze-like layouts and late-night shopping culture. Would you like to explore both?",

For Don Quijote, the Shibuya store is iconic - it's nine floors of organized chaos, with everything from luxury goods to local snacks. Would you like to know what each floor specializes in?",
