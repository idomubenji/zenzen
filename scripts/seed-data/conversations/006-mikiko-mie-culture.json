Mie is also home to Japan's most sacred shrine, Ise Jingu, and has wonderful traditional crafts like Iga pottery and Kumano brushes. What aspects interest you most?",

Besides Kumano brushes and Iga pottery, I'd recommend Matsusaka cotton (traditional indigo-dyed textiles), Ise Udon noodles (they come in gift sets), and if you visit the pearl divers, Ama-made accessories using small pearls.
