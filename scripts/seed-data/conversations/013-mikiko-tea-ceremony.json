There are several respected schools in Tokyo and Kyoto that offer both introductory experiences and longer-term study.

The Urasenke school in Kyoto offers excellent beginner programs with English support, while in Tokyo, the Omotesenke Fushin'an provides intimate classes in a traditional setting. Both emphasize mindfulness and proper form. Would you like details about their introductory programs?",

You'll learn basic guest etiquette, how to properly enter the tea room, how to appreciate the seasonal decorations, and how to receive and drink the tea. Wear plain, conservative clothing and white socks. They provide tabi socks if needed. The schools recommend avoiding strong perfumes and arriving 10 minutes early. Would you like the full preparation guidelines?",
