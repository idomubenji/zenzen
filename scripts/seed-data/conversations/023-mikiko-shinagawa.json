Shinagawa was historically the first post station on the Tokaido road to Kyoto, and you can still find traces of that history in areas like Kitashinagawa. Meanwhile, the station area has developed into one of Tokyo's major business hubs. Would you like to explore both aspects?",

There's also Honsenji Temple, which served travelers, and several traditional shops that have been operating for generations. Would you like a walking route through these historic spots?",

The area around the station was transformed with skyscrapers housing major corporations. The InterCity complex is particularly interesting - it was designed to create a 'city within a city'.
