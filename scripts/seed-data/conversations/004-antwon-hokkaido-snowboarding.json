Both are famous for their deep powder and challenging terrain. Do you have a specific month in mind for your trip?",

Niseko has excellent backcountry access through gates, but you'll need to register and get a backcountry pass. All trails are marked in both Japanese and English, and they use an international color-coding system. Would you like me to explain the backcountry safety protocols?",

As for Rusutsu, it's less crowded than Niseko and has amazing tree runs. The terrain park is smaller, but the natural features and powder bowls are incredible. They also have night skiing until 8:30 PM.",

There's also great Hokkaido beef and fresh seafood at places like Bang Bang and Ezo Seafoods.",
